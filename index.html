                                The output of a mathematical function depends only only on its inputs.  This makes
                                mathematical functions easier to reason about because you can just substitute the output
                                for the function call. Pure functional languages, like Haskell completely avoid changing
                                state by encapsulating state changes in their data, but Erlang and Elixir are not pure
                                like Haskell.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Haskell is pure because all it's IO is recorded as data and it's only the VM evaluating
                                that data as actions that cause external, side-effects.  Any function call in Haskell
                                is completely specified by its inputs, which can include the previous IO actions that
                                are queued up.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                By contrast, Erlang and Elixir do allow immediate side-effect by communicating with
                                other processes.  STDIO and STDOUT is presentated by processes in Erlang and Elixir,
                                so the impurity of doing IO is covered by process communication.

                            have to worry about race conditions and other threading bugs.

                                Functional languages originated from Church's lambda calculus which is super cryptic
                                with only &lambda;, <code>x</code>, and <code>.</code>.  Other functional languages
                                like the Lisps, including Scheme and Clojure, use more parentheses than most people are
                                comfortable with. Haskell's syntax abstracts types and function arguments/returns and
                                drops parantheses.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Coming from an imperative and object oriented background we're so used to mutability
                                that we think of it as normal even though when we first learned it, mutability was odd
                                compared to math's fixed values for variables and pure functions.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Because most languages don't support tail call optimization or the lesser tail call
                                recursion, we've been trained to reach for the iterative solution to avoid stack
                                overflows, but a lot of problems in computing have much nicer recursive solutions.
                                With general tail call optimization, loops involving more than one function can be
                                represented in what would look like recursion.

                                Just as you learned imperative programming over mathematical thinking, you can retrain
                                to think in functional languages and even switch back and forth.  I currently switch
                                between Java, Ruby, and Elixir.  With only a few hiccups on namespace syntax and
                                string quoting.  If you're used to using <code>map</code> or <code>select</code> from
                                <code>Enumerable</code> in Ruby or the lambda expression features in Java 8, you are
                                already using functional programming.  If you ever used class methods in Ruby that
                                didn't write to class or instance variable.  Or, if you ever used static methods in
                                Java.  You're already using functional programming.

                                Learning functional programming will also prepare you for the future.  If you watch
                                conference talks in other langauges, such as Javascript or C++, languages are moving to
                                have more and more functional features as the programming community adapts to the
                                many-cores future.  They have figured out that locks, threads, and shared mutable
                                state is too error prone.

                                Moore's law increasing processor speed stopped 10 years ago. If you want to take
                                advantage of Moore's law now and in the future you need to write concurrent programs now
                                that can be parallelized across the additional cores of the future automatically.

                            Erlang was developed in 1986 at Ericsson by Joe Armstrong, Robert Virding and Mike Williams.
                            It was developed to run phone switches.  It needed to be able to update code without
                            dropping in progress calls and handle thousands of simultaneous connections using a single
                            embedded system from the late 80s.  It was written to show that replacing low-level C
                            for the phone switches would lead to more reliable software with a smaller code base, which
                            it did.

                                Erlang is know for it's "Let It Crash!" motto, but letting code crash in the face of
                                software and hardware exceptions is not exactly what it means. Instead, Erlang supplies
                                VM-level processes.  In other languages, such as Ruby these would be green-threads,
                                which would be bad for performance and scheduling, but because Erlang is immutable, each
                                green-thread is completely isolated from the other green-threads, so much like OS
                                processes, the name process is apt because if an Erlang process crashes, just killing it
                                will clean everything up.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If a process is killed when it crashes how is state maintained?  Well, Erlang processes
                                can monitor each other so if one process crashes another is notified.  This pattern is
                                so useful that OTP, Erlang's standard library has a behavior (think abstract class or
                                interface) called a supervisor that monitors a process and restarts it when it dies.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Inside each process, code is written sequentially.  Processes communicate with each
                                other only by passing immutable messages.  This makes Erlang processes closer to the
                                idea for objects described in Alan Kay's original papers than objects in most
                                current Object-Oriented languages like Ruby.

                                One of the recent success stories with Erlang is WhatsApp.  It was acquired by Facebook
                                in 2014.  In 2012 they were supporting over 2 million simultaneous connection on a
                                single machine using 24 cores.  The Erlang VM was able to schedule that many
                                simultaneous processes because there is only one OS thread for each scheduler and each
                                scheduler is assigned a core.  This keeps works from going across cores unless processes
                                want to communicate, but they message pass, so there's no shared memory issues with
                                caches or system memory like in other languages.

                            tuple.  <code>when is_number(r)</code> is guard.  Guards are used to restrict the type of
                            parameters allowed or to enforce relationships between variable in a pattern that can't be
                            expressed directly in the pattern shape.

                            Since data is immutable, but tail calls are optimized, loops can be converted to tail recursive
                            calls where the result of the loop is carried in an accumulator.  The base case of the loop is
                            then to return the accumulator.  Having the base case in a separate function clause makes it much
                            more obvious that the passed in value will be the return when the list is empty than when using
                            a <code>for</code> loop or recursion with <code>if</code> statements in an imperative language.

                                The <code>fn -></code> syntax is for an anonymous function like stabby lambdas in Ruby,
                                CoffeeScript, ES6, or lambda expressions in Java 8.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I spawn a process passing an anonymous function and have it wait to receive
                                <code>:ping</code>.  When it receive ping it will respond to the sender with
                                <code>:pong</code>.  receive will wait for message to be received or pick the first
                                message that matches from the process's mailbox.  There are no objects in Elixir, so
                                <code>self</code> returns the current process's pid instead.  <code>flush</code> dumps
                                the current processes mailbox without needing to use <code>receive</code>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Sending messages between processes is very similar to how you use <code>send</code> to
                                send messages to objects.  Using mailboxes and <code>receive</code>, the process has
                                more control than objects in Ruby.  The receiving process is free to ignore the message.

                            Syntax, so the question becomes why use Elixir instead of Erlang?  It comes down to the
                            three main features José Valim wanted to added to Erlang when making Elixir: tooling,
                            metaprogramming, and polymorphism.

                            allows manipulating the Abstract Syntax Tree, which means we can delay execution just like

                                Here, we download the list of know mime-types and create functions that match the known names.
                                This way, the compiler can optimize the lookup based on prefixes and we don't need to ship
                                and parse a file at runtime.

                                This approach is also used to enable Elixir to have full Unicode
                                support including proper support for graphemes vs codepoints, such as when the accent is

                                Erlang doesn't have protocols, so in it you have to either fork and update a function
                                to support your new data format or write wrapper functions that handle your new data
                                type and the old data type supported by the library.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In Ruby, we could monkey patch a class to support new methods.  In Java, reflection
                                would have to be used to add new methods to a pre-existing class or a method would need
                                to be implemented from an interface.  In Elixir, protocols can be defined that expose
                                new methods and then implementations of that protocol can be registered for different
                                types, but importantly, the protocol and type don't need to know about each other.  The
                                implementation can be done independently and Elixir will look it up and call it when
                                using the protocol.

                                Structs allow new types to be defined that can be used in protocols.  They are built on
                                top of maps, but they have compile guarantees that the keys are correct.  In Erlang,
                                it's not possible to create new data types.  The closest that can be done is records,
                                which are just tuples where the first element is an atom with the record's name, but the
                                record syntax is clunky compared to Structs.  Example taken from the Phoenix docs.

                                All state has to be returned from functions if not passing messages, and IO is passing
                                messages, so that means function calls have to take the output of a previous function,
                                so we'd either have to deeply nest function calls, or use variables that are assigned on
                                one line and used only on the next, but thinking about how *nix shells work, we could
                                instead make a pipeline.

                                The <code>|></code> operator takes the left operand and passes it as the first argument
                                of the right operand.  Just like piping stdout to stdin in a shell.

                                Like most of the cool features of Elixir, the <code>|></code> operator is a macro that
                                just rearranges the pipeline back to the deeply nested function call form.
